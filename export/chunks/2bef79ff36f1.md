## Browser compatibility notes

- Folder picking is browser-dependent:
  - Chromium (Chrome/Edge): `showDirectoryPicker` (best experience; preserves paths).
  - WebKit (Safari): folder input via `webkitdirectory` (preserves paths).
  - Firefox/Floorp: folder picking is not supported; use `Select files` or drag-and-drop.
- In Firefox/Floorp, the app may fall back to running WASM on the main thread if module workers fail; ingestion will still work but the UI can stutter during heavy ingest/search.
- If the tab crashes during ingest, reduce the total input size (defaults: 10 MB per file, 50 MB total) or ingest a smaller subset of the repo.
