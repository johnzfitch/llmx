### What NOT To Do
- ❌ Don't use `ort` crate (doesn't compile to WASM)
- ❌ Don't use `ureq` or `reqwest` for downloads (use browser fetch)
- ❌ Don't store models in filesystem paths (use IndexedDB)
- ❌ Don't create new MCP tools (use `use_semantic` flag)
- ❌ Don't block on GPU operations (all async)
- ❌ Don't bundle model weights in WASM binary (fetch separately)
