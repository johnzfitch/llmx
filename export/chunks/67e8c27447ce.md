# Review Report

Reviewer: High Code Reviewer (automated)

Status: Conditional sign-off

Findings:

1) HTML parsing is regex-based and may miss edge cases; however, UI rendering is text-only.
   Risk: low for XSS because rendering uses `textContent`.
   Action: acceptable for prototype; replace with structured HTML parser for production.

2) JSON provenance line ranges are best-effort and often coarse.
   Risk: low for security, medium for accuracy.
   Action: document limitation (done) and improve mapping later.

3) Zip export ignores write errors.
   Risk: medium for reliability.
   Action: add error handling for production; prototype acceptable.

Sign-off: Approved for prototype with the above noted limitations.
