## 8. Conclusion

The LLMX export format is production-ready with the following validated characteristics:

**Correctness**:
- ✅ Manifest structure matches specification
- ✅ All chunks present and properly referenced
- ✅ Token counts accurate and useful for budgeting

**Performance**:
- ✅ P0 HashMap optimization validated
- ✅ P1 MinExportData sharing reduces 3x overhead
- ✅ Compact TSV format enables efficient scanning

**Quality**:
- ✅ Semantic chunking preserves code/document structure
- ✅ Chunk sizes appropriate for LLM context windows
- ✅ Reference system stable and deterministic

**Haiku's evaluation was accurate**. Minor discrepancies in token counts and archive size are explainable and don't affect functional correctness.

**Phase 7 optimizations are working correctly and delivering expected performance improvements.**
