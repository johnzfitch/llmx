### Layer B: Echo Patterns (15D) - The Core
**Purpose**: SpecHO's original innovation - detecting "echoes" in language  
**Status**: **This was missing in the 24D version** (critical bug)  
**Implementation**: `src/fingerprint/layer_b_echo.py`

**What are "echo patterns"?**
Based on the architecture, likely analyzing:
- Repetitive phrasing across paragraphs
- Self-referential structures (text that "echoes" itself)
- Harmonic patterns in sentence rhythm
- Vocabulary recycling frequency
- Conceptual reverberations (same idea, different words)

**Why 15 dimensions?**: Probably captures:
- Short-range echoes (within paragraph)
- Medium-range echoes (across sections)
- Long-range echoes (document-level)
- Echo intensity, frequency, decay rate

**Relevance to code**: Code has intentional repetition (patterns, idioms) but also organic variation. AI code might show different echo signatures.
