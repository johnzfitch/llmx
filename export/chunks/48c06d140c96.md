## Success Metrics

**How to measure if enhancements work**:

```
Baseline (current):
- Chunks to answer: 15-20
- Token usage: 12K average
- Search precision@5: 60%
- Time to answer: 8 seconds

After SPLADE + Quality:
- Chunks to answer: 3-5 (3x better)
- Token usage: 4K average (67% reduction)
- Search precision@5: 75% (15% improvement)
- Time to answer: 2 seconds (4x faster)
```

**Track in Phase 5**: Capture metrics before/after
