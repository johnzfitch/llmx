### Pre-Deployment Testing (Recommended)

- [ ] Manual test with Claude Code (30 min) - See PHASE_4_MCP_VERIFICATION.md
- [ ] Test BM25-only search (default behavior)
- [ ] Test hybrid search with `use_semantic: true`
- [ ] Verify embeddings persist across index load/save
- [ ] Test with old indexes (should load successfully)
- [ ] Test with large codebase (1000+ chunks)
