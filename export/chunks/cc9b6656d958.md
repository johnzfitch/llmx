## Option A (recommended): Playwright smoke testing (no LLM, no network)

This avoids introducing an external model into the loop and keeps tests reproducible.

High-level approach:

1) Serve `web/` locally (see `docs/USAGE.md`)
2) Use Playwright to load `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`
3) Assert:
   - WASM loads (no console errors)
   - ingest a small fixture set
   - search returns results
   - outline/symbol filters populate for a chosen file
