## Conclusion

Two major blockers resolved. The remaining getrandom issue is a known limitation in the Burn + WASM ecosystem, not a flaw in the implementation. The recommended path forward is either:
- Use Transformers.js for browser embeddings (fastest path to production)
- Wait for Burn ecosystem to properly support WASM + getrandom 0.3
- Use pre-tokenized input pattern to reduce WASM surface area

The native build works, allowing continued development of the embedding pipeline, with browser deployment deferred until the ecosystem catches up.
