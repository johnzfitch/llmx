### chunks/*.md

- One file per chunk: `chunks/{ref}.md` (slug is stored in front matter for readability).
- YAML front matter header with provenance and hashes, followed by the chunk body.
- For text chunks, repeated identical lines may be compacted during export when a
  run exceeds the threshold (default: 3).
