### Phase 5 Philosophy

**Start with correctness, optimize later**:
1. Get semantic search working (any embedding model)
2. Verify it improves search relevance
3. Then optimize (batch generation, caching, etc.)

**Maintain Phase 4 quality**:
- Keep tests passing
- Keep docs updated
- Keep performance excellent
- Keep architecture clean

**Trust the foundation**:
- Phase 4 is solid
- BM25 works well
- Token budgeting works
- Build on this, don't rewrite
