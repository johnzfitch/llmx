## Assistant

The user wants me to check the llmx codebase to understand the project structure and determine if llm.cat and llmx share a codebase or are separate.
The path doesn't exist. Let me try listing the allowed directories first.
Okay, let me check what's actually in /home/zack/dev/
The filesystem access isn't working for the user's actual machine. This is expected - I'm running in a container that doesn't have access to their local machine's filesystem. I should tell them this and ask them to describe the codebase structure or share relevant files.Can't access your local filesystem from here (container sandbox). 

Can you share:
1. Does llm.cat live inside `/home/zack/dev/llmx/` or is it a separate repo?
2. Quick `tree -L 2` or `ls` output of the llmx directory?

Or just tell me: is llm.cat a separate frontend that calls llmx, or are they the same Rust codebase with different build targets?
