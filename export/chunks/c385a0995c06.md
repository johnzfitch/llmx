### What Went Well

1. **Incremental approach**
   - Started with RRF (no dependencies)
   - Then hybrid search (pure logic)
   - Then model integration (blocked but isolated)

2. **Backward compatibility**
   - All Phase 5 code still works
   - No breaking changes
   - Migration is opt-in

3. **Testing philosophy**
   - RRF has excellent tests
   - Verified against known behaviors
   - Can prove correctness without model
