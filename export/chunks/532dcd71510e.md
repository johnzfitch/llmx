Should I implement Phase 6 for both native (desktop MCP server) and WASM (browser)
 targets, or focus exclusively on WASM/browser deployment?
❯ 1. Both native and WASM
     Burn works on both. Native gets Vulkan/Metal, browser gets WebGPU. More work
     but maximum compatibility.
  2. WASM/browser only (Recommended)
     Focus on llm.cat browser deployment as specified in directions. Simpler,
     aligned with Phase 6 goals.
  3. Type something.
