## Architecture (Client-only WASM)

1. User selects a folder (File System Access API) or drags files.
2. WASM ingestor scans files, chunks by type, builds index, exports artifacts.
3. Persist index locally (IndexedDB or OPFS) and allow offline retrieval.

Browser notes:

- Folder selection is not universal:
  - Chromium browsers typically support `showDirectoryPicker` (File System Access API).
  - Some browsers support folder upload via `<input type="file" webkitdirectory>`.
  - Firefox/Floorp generally require file selection or drag-and-drop (no native folder picker).
- Worker/WASM support varies by browser version; the UI should provide a main-thread fallback for environments where module workers fail.

No server upload is required at any stage.
