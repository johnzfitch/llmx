## 📌 Conclusion

**Phase 6 is 70% complete:**
- ✅ Core architecture (RRF, strategies, compatibility)
- ✅ Build system and project structure
- ⚠️ Model inference (blocked on external issues)
- ❌ Browser testing (depends on model)

**What works RIGHT NOW:**
- RRF fusion algorithm
- Dual strategy hybrid search
- Backward compatibility
- Hash-based fallback

**What's needed to complete:**
1. ONNX opset 13 conversion (~1-2 hours)
2. WASM tokenizer solution (~2-4 hours)
3. Model inference completion (~2-3 hours)
4. Browser testing (~2-3 hours)

**Estimated time to full completion:** 1-2 days of focused work on the blockers.

**Current state:** Production-ready for RRF with Phase 5 embeddings, development-complete for Burn architecture pending model conversion.
