## Questions to Consider

**Q: Should we apply all patches or cherry-pick?**
A: Recommend all patches - they're well-tested, low-risk, high-value

**Q: What about embeddings-related changes?**
A: Skip them - stable uses BM25 only, embeddings not applicable

**Q: How long until we can deploy?**
A: 1-2 days with thorough testing, could be faster for critical fixes only

**Q: What's the rollback plan?**
A: Simple git revert + rsync previous version (5 minutes)

**Q: Should we merge to main branch too?**
A: Depends on branching strategy - these fixes already in burn-test-final
