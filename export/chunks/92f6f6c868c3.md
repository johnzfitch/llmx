### Human Browsing Experience

**Pros**:
- ✅ All files are plain text (TSV and Markdown)
- ✅ Manifest is scannable in any text editor
- ✅ Chunk files preserve original formatting
- ✅ Clear structure: llm.md explains everything
- ✅ No binary formats, no proprietary encodings

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Navigating 288 separate chunk files is tedious
- ⚠️ Manifest requires understanding row types (D/P/K/F/C)
- ⚠️ References like `c0050` require lookup to find content
- ⚠️ Original file structure is flattened into chunks
