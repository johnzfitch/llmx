### Layer C: Epistemic Markers (12D)
**Purpose**: Uncertainty and discourse structure  
**Split into 2 sub-layers**:

**C.1: Epistemic Hedging (6D)**  
Examples of features:
- Hedging frequency ("might", "could", "possibly")
- Certainty modifiers ("definitely", "clearly", "obviously")
- Epistemic verb patterns ("believe", "think", "suppose")
- Qualification density (caveats per assertion)
- Modal verb distributions
- Confidence gradients

**C.2: Discourse Transitions (6D)**  
Examples of features:
- Logical connectors ("therefore", "however", "moreover")
- Transition word diversity
- Paragraph bridging patterns
- Structural signaling ("first", "finally", "in conclusion")
- Coherence markers density
- Temporal sequencing language

**Relevance to code**: Comments in code have distinctive epistemic patterns. Human code comments often hedge ("this might not work if..."), while AI comments might be overly certain or formulaic.
