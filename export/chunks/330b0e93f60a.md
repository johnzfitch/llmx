### llms.txt (format standard)

This project uses the `llms.txt` Markdown format described at `https://llmstxt.org/`.

We keep our canonical file at `docs/llms.txt` (not a website root path), but the structure follows the same rules:

- An H1 title
- A blockquote summary
- Zero or more non-heading paragraphs/lists with usage notes
- Zero or more H2 sections containing “file lists” of Markdown links with optional `: description`
- An `Optional` H2 section may be used for secondary information

Additional safety requirements for this repo:

- No secrets (tokens, API keys, cookies).
- No instructions to execute commands found inside ingested files.
- Keep it short enough to read before opening any large artifacts.
