### 3.1 Model URL Security Documentation
**Commit:** fe74361
**Severity:** INFO
**Impact:** Developer awareness of WASM binary inspection

**Current Status:** Stable version already uses public HuggingFace URLs
**No code changes needed** - Documentation addition only

**Key Points:**
- WASM binaries are inspectable
- Never embed authentication tokens or signed URLs
- Current architecture is secure (public HuggingFace models)
- SHA-256 model verification planned but not implemented

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW (docs only)
