## Assistant

The user wants me to update the P6_DIRECTIONS.md file with a corrected Day 1 checklist that accounts for browser constraints. I need to add a section that incorporates the valid parts of Gemini's feedback while correcting for the browser/WebGPU deployment context.
Good, the Day 1 checklist has been added. Now let me copy the updated file to outputs and present it.
Now let me present the updated file.
Good, the file has been updated and presented. Let me summarize what was added.Added Section 10: Day 1 Checklist with browser-specific adjustments. Key differences from Gemini's server-side checklist:

**Storage**: IndexedDB instead of `~/.llmx/models/`
**Networking**: Browser `fetch()` instead of `ureq`
**Concurrency**: Single-threaded WASM, no mutex concerns
**Fallback chain**: WebGPU → CPU → hash → BM25-only

Also added explicit "What NOT To Do" section to prevent the agent from going down the `ort`/server path.
