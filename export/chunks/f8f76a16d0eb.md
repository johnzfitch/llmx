### 2. Integration Tests

**Current state**: "No new tests added for MCP layer"

**Reviewer's take**: "acceptable - integration tests would require MCP client simulation"

**My take**: This is fine for Phase 4, but Phase 5/6 should add:
- Integration test that spins up server in test mode
- Mock MCP client that calls tools
- Verify end-to-end workflows

**Not blocking Phase 5**, but add to Phase 6 checklist.
