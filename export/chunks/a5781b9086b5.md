## Assistant

The agent has made good progress. They've:
1. Fixed the async constructor deprecation by switching to a factory pattern (`Embedder.create()` instead of `new Embedder()`)
2. Fixed unnecessary mut warning
3. Pushed the changes

The remaining warnings are expected - they're for code that's stubbed out waiting for Phase 7 (weight loading, inference).

The user seems to be showing me progress updates. I should acknowledge this is good progress and note what's left.Good. Factory pattern is the right call—`wasm-bindgen` has been deprecating async constructors for a while.

**Status:**
- ✅ WASM compiles
- ✅ Critical warnings fixed
- ✅ API pattern corrected (`Embedder.create()`)
- ⚠️ Remaining warnings are stubs for unimplemented inference

**What's actually left:**
1. Weight loading (fetch safetensors → IndexedDB)
2. Forward pass implementation
3. Mean pooling + L2 norm
4. Browser integration test

These are all in `embeddings_burn.rs`. The architecture is done, now it's filling in the inference logic.

Is the agent continuing to Phase 7, or pausing here?
