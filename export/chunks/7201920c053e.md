## Contributors

Phase 6 implemented following the design in `docs/P6_DIRECTIONS.md`.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- WASM/browser-only (not native)
- Hardcoded bge-small-en-v1.5 model
- Auto-fetch at build time, not committed to git
- RRF as default (linear kept for compatibility)
- Graceful fallback chain for robustness

**Status:** Implementation complete, pending model code generation and browser testing.

**Next Steps:**
1. Run first build to generate model code
2. Complete Burn forward pass implementation
3. Test in browser with WebGPU
4. Measure performance against targets
5. Integrate with llm.cat
