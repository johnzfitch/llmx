## What to Tell the Team

> Phase 4 is complete and production-ready. The MCP server is clean, safe, and functional. All clippy warnings resolved, all tests passing, zero unsafe code. The 4-tool consolidation works as designed (search returns content inline, eliminating round-trips). Minor polish needed: add API docs, baseline benchmarks, and real agent testing. Ready to proceed with Phase 5 semantic search integration.

**Next steps**: 
1. Document current API (1-2 hours)
2. Add baseline benchmarks (2-3 hours)
3. Test with Claude Code (30 minutes)
4. Begin Phase 5 planning (embeddings integration)

**Timeline**: Phase 5 can start next week after polish items complete.
