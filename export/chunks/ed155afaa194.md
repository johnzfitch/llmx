## User

he directions recommend bge-small-en-v1.5 (384-dim, 33MB). Should I implement model
selection or hardcode this model?
❯ 1. Hardcode bge-small-en-v1.5 (Recommended)
     Ship with one proven model. Users can search immediately. Simpler
     implementation, faster iteration.
  2. Support multiple models
     Add nomic-embed-text-v1.5 as alternative. More flexible but increases complexity
      and testing surface.
  3. Type something.
