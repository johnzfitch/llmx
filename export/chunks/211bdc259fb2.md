### ✅ Completed Goals

| Goal | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| MCP server works | Tests passing, clippy clean |
| 4 tools implemented | All present and functional |
| Search returns inline content | Token budgeting working |
| Error handling robust | `anyhow` → `McpError` conversion |
| Feature-gated binary | `#[cfg(feature = "mcp")]` used correctly |
