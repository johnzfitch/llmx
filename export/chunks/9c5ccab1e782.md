## Final Solution

The key was using the correct getrandom configuration for WASM:

```toml
# ingestor-wasm/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
getrandom = { version = "0.3.3", default-features = false, features = ["wasm_js"] }
```

**Key differences from initial attempts:**
1. Version `0.3.3` (not `0.2.x` or `0.3.4`)
2. `default-features = false` (critical!)
3. Feature is `wasm_js` (not `js`)
4. Direct dependency, not workspace or patch
