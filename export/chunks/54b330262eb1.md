### What Was Challenging

1. **Dependency management**
   - Burn ecosystem is young
   - Version conflicts exist
   - WASM compatibility is hard

2. **ONNX ecosystem**
   - Opset versions fragmented
   - Model exports vary
   - Tools have different support

3. **WASM limitations**
   - Many crates don't compile
   - Native dependencies fail
   - Need alternative solutions
