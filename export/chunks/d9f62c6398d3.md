## Safety & Privacy

- Treat file contents as untrusted; render via `textContent` only.
- Strip scripts/styles from HTML before indexing.
- No network calls during ingestion.
- Enforce size limits: `max_file_bytes`, `max_total_bytes`.
- Redact secrets in logs; avoid printing raw file content in errors.
