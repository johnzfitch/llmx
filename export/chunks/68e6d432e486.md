### Current Phase 5 Limitations

1. **Hash-Based Embeddings**: Not true semantic understanding
   - Works for infrastructure testing
   - Deterministic and fast
   - Will be upgraded to real models in Phase 6

2. **Fixed Weights**: 50/50 BM25 + semantic
   - Cannot be adjusted per query
   - Works well as default
   - Future: Configurable weights

3. **No Query Expansion**: Queries used as-is
   - No synonym injection
   - No automatic query rewriting
   - Future: LLM-based query expansion
