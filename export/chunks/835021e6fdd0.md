## Stable Chunk IDs

- Chunk content is hashed with sha256.
- Chunk ID = sha256(path + "\n" + content_hash + "\n" + occurrence_index).
- `occurrence_index` is the ordinal among identical content hashes in a file.
- Deterministic ordering is enforced by sorting files and chunks.
- `slug` is intentionally capped in length and typically uses only the most local
  context (e.g., the last Markdown/HTML heading) to stay token-efficient.
