### When to Expect Better Results

**Semantic search improves results when**:
- Query is conceptual or abstract
- Codebase uses varied terminology
- Looking for patterns, not names
- Natural language questions

**BM25 is sufficient when**:
- Searching for specific identifiers
- Need exact keyword matches
- Query is already precise
- Fast response critical
