### ✅ Blocker 2: Tokenizer WASM Incompatibility
**Status:** RESOLVED

Added tokenizers with WASM support:
```toml
tokenizers = { version = "0.20", default-features = false, features = ["unstable_wasm"] }
```

**Integration:**
- `ingestor-wasm/src/embeddings_burn.rs` - Tokenizer fully integrated
- Both WgpuEmbeddingGenerator and CpuEmbeddingGenerator have working tokenizers
- Loads tokenizer from CDN or cache at runtime
