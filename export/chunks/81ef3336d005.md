### Chunk Statistics

```
Average: 1,774.4 tokens/chunk
Minimum: 0 tokens (empty boundary chunks)
Maximum: 24,629 tokens (large diff chunks)
```

**Analysis**:
- Semantic chunking is working correctly
- Function/method level boundaries respected in JavaScript
- Empty chunks (0 tokens) are boundary markers between file versions
- Large chunks (>10k tokens) are intentional for diff sections
