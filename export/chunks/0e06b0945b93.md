## Cutting-Edge != Complex

**Note**: All these enhancements maintain llmx's philosophy:
- ✅ Clean architecture
- ✅ Minimal dependencies
- ✅ Fast by default
- ✅ Agent-first design

**Not included**: Features that violate these principles
- ❌ Heavy frameworks (Elasticsearch, etc.)
- ❌ Complex ML pipelines (transformers for everything)
- ❌ Over-engineering (distributed systems for 10MB indexes)

**Philosophy**: **Smart > Clever**

Simple solutions that work > Complex solutions that impress
