## Known Challenges
1. **Model selection**: Balance between quality, speed, and privacy
2. **Dimensionality**: Higher dims = better quality but slower search
3. **Token limits**: Long code chunks may need truncation/splitting
4. **Cold start**: First embedding generation is slow; need progress indicator
5. **Cost**: API-based embeddings cost money; local models solve this
