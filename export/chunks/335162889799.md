### Phase 2: Validate (if Phase 1 succeeds)

**Research questions**:
- Do linguistic features correlate with agent usefulness?
- Can we predict which chunks agents will find valuable?
- Does quality scoring improve search ranking?

**Benchmark dataset**:
- 100 code chunks
- Human ratings (developers)
- Agent ratings (which chunks were actually used)
- Correlation analysis
