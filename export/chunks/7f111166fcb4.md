### What Works

✅ **Architecture is sound**
- RRF algorithm is elegant and well-tested
- Backward compatibility is thorough
- Fallback chain is robust
- Code is well-documented

✅ **Integration is clean**
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- SearchInput naturally extended
- HybridStrategy enum is clear
- Tests prove correctness

✅ **Performance path exists**
- Burn framework is correct choice
- WebGPU backend makes sense
- Build system is efficient
- Caching strategy is good
