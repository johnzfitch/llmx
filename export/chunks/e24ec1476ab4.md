## Assistant

The user is asking about what file types llm.cat currently accepts. I should search my conversation history to find information about llm.cat's current capabilities.
The search didn't return specific information about llm.cat's supported file types. Let me search more specifically.
I'm not finding the specific file types that llm.cat currently accepts. Let me search for the llmx ingestor code or file handling specifically.I don't have the llm.cat source indexed. Based on the llmx/ingestor-core patterns from our discussions, it likely supports:

**Code files** (via tree-sitter):
- JavaScript/TypeScript (`.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`)
- Python (`.py`)
- Rust (`.rs`)
- Go (`.go`)
- And others with tree-sitter grammars

**Documentation**:
- Markdown (`.md`)
- Plain text (`.txt`)
- HTML (`.html`)

**Structured data**:
- JSON (`.json`)
- YAML (`.yaml`, `.yml`)

**Images** (as assets, not parsed):
- PNG, JPG, etc. — stored as references, not chunked

Can you confirm by checking the actual ingestor code? Or tell me what's in `/home/zack/dev/llmx/ingestor-core/src/` and I can give you a more precise answer based on the tree-sitter configs and file handlers.
