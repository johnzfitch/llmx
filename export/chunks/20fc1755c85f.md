## Notes
- Start with local ONNX models for privacy and cost
- RRF is more robust than linear combination (fewer hyperparameters)
- Consider lazy loading embeddings (only in memory when needed)
- Semantic search shines for natural language queries about code
- BM25 still better for exact identifier matching
