## Notes

- The UI loads `web/pkg/ingestor_wasm.js` produced by `wasm-pack`.
- Ingestion runs entirely in the browser; no network calls are required.
- Heavy work (ingest/search) runs in a Web Worker to reduce UI freezes.
- If `mise` complains the config is untrusted: `mise trust ~/dev/llmx/.mise.toml`.
- Images: Phase 1 ingests common screenshot formats and includes them in `export.zip` under `images/`. No OCR is performed yet; search matches mainly via filename/path.
