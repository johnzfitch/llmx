## User

Should I download the ONNX model now and set up the build process, or would you
prefer to provide the model file?
❯ 1. Download automatically (Recommended)
     I'll fetch bge-small-en-v1.5 from HuggingFace and set up build.rs to convert it.
      Fully automated.
  2. You'll provide it
     You'll download the model manually and place it in the repo. I'll just set up
     the conversion pipeline.
  3. Type something.
