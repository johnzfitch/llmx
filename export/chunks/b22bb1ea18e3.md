## 1. Embedding Model Selection

**Recommended: `bge-small-en-v1.5`** (drop-in replacement)
- 384-dim (matches current hash-based)
- Significantly outperforms MiniLM on MTEB
- BAAI/Alibaba, well-maintained
- ~33MB ONNX → smaller after Burn compilation

**Alternative: `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`** (quality option)
- 768-dim native, supports Matryoshka (truncate to 256/384/512 at inference)
- Apache 2.0 license
- Better for code than general-purpose models
- ~137MB - may be too large for browser first-load

**Avoid:**
- `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` - dated (2021), superseded by above
- `ort` crate - doesn't compile to WASM
- Voyage/OpenAI APIs - requires server round-trip, defeats local-only goal
