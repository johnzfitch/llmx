Sample Plain Text File
======================

This is a sample plain text file for testing the llmx indexer.

Section 1: Introduction
-----------------------

Plain text files are commonly used for documentation, configuration,
and simple data storage. The indexer should handle them correctly.

Section 2: Features
-------------------

The text file format has the following characteristics:

  * No formatting markup
  * Simple line-based structure
  * Universal compatibility
  * Human-readable

Section 3: Content Examples
---------------------------

Here are some example patterns that might appear in text files:

  1. Numbered lists like this one
  2. Configuration-style key=value pairs
  3. Log file entries with timestamps
  4. README-style documentation

Example configuration:
  server.host = localhost
  server.port = 8080
  debug.enabled = true
  log.level = info

Example log entries:
  2024-01-15 10:30:45 INFO Starting application
  2024-01-15 10:30:46 INFO Connected to database
  2024-01-15 10:30:47 WARN Configuration file not found

Section 4: Conclusion
---------------------

This file serves as test content for verifying text file indexing.
The indexer should properly chunk and index this content.
